          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>The OSG facilitates access to distributed high throughput computing for research in the US.
            The resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by the community, organized by the OSG, and governed by the OSG consortium.
            In the last 12 months, we have provided more than 1.2 billion CPU hours to researchers across a wide variety of projects.

          <hr>
          <p>Researchers can run jobs on OSG from their home institution or <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org/">OSG's centrally-operated submission service, OSG Connect</a> (available for US-based research and scholarship).</p>

          <h3>Sharing Is Key</h3>
          <hr>
          <p><em>Sharing is a core principle of the OSG.</em>  Over 100 million CPU hours delivered on the OSG in the past year were opportunistic: they would have remained on but idle
            if it wasn't for the OSG. Sharing allows individual researchers to access larger computing resources and large organizations to keep their utilization high.</p>
