    Our annual <a href="http://htcondor.org/HTCondorWeek2022">HTCondor Week</a>
    user conference will take place from May 23-26. This year,
    HTCondor Week will be a hybrid event: we are hosting an in-person meeting at
    the Fluno Center on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. This provides
    HTCondor Week attendees with a compelling environment in which to attend tutorials and talks from
    HTCondor developers, meet other users like you and attend social events. For
    those who cannot attend in person, we'll also be broadcasting the event online
    via Zoom.

    We will have a variety of in-depth tutorials and talks where you
    can learn more about HTCondor and how other people are using and deploying HTCondor. Best of all, you can establish contacts and learn best practices from people in industry, government, and academia who are using HTCondor to solve hard problems, many of which
    may be similar to those you are facing.

    We'd love to have you give a talk at HTCondor Week. Talks are 15-20 minutes long and are a
    great way to share your ideas and get feedback from the community. If you have a compelling
    use of HTCondor you'd like to share, see our <a href="https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/1733/abstracts/">Speaker Information page</a>
