      Frank Wuerthwein – The State of the OSG
   </a>
</h4>
<p>
   In this presentation, Frank Wuerthwein discusses the goals of the OSG Consortium to further the advancement of
   all open science. Wuerthwein further defines the OSG vision to create access to an open cyberinfrastructure for
   all and push forward democratized access across the nation. There is a brief overview of concepts such as compute
   research pools, the OSG Data Federation, data origins, and global namespaces. Additionally, there’s an in-depth
   discussion about the Open Science Pool community.

      Brian Bockelman – Introducing the PATh Facility
   </a>
</h4>
<p>
   In this overview of PATh facilities, Brian Bockelman describes technologies, services, and resources.
   Access points are defined, such as OSG Connect, and they serve as a portal to different research pools.
   Bockelman discusses the Open Science Pool (OSPool) and breaks down the dividing process of opportunistic
   or donated resources within the OSPool. Additionally, there is a clarification on credit accounts and a
   snapshot of plans with the PATh facility.

      Kevin Thompson – Democratizing Access to Cyberinfrastructure
   </a>
</h4>
<p>
   Kevin Thompson breaks down the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) priorities and provides
   a general foundation overview. It also reveals several outside organizations that will assist with
   implementing NSF visions to improve community access to cyberinfrastructure. NSF has goals to
   support various allocations and explore and develop models for increased support to democratize access.

        Frank Wuerthwein, Lauren Michael – Expanding OSG Services for Campuses
    </a>
</h4>
<p>
    Overview of OSG services such as compute resource pools, access points, and
    compute entry points. Frank and Lauren discuss the process of receiving access to these services, how they work,
    and regular user training sessions. The functionality of OSG services is practical and flexible for
    individual and campus needs.

        Anirban Pal – High-Performance Computing in the Texas Panhandle and beyond
    </a>
</h4>
<p>
    West Texas A&M University has a strong need for HPC for research and educational needs.
    This institution is a considerably rural Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) with data-intensive
    science drivers that would benefit from high-performance computation. The institution received a
    CC* award to install a computer data center on campus and has connected with OSG services as a first
    step to closing the knowledge gap.

        Bennet Fauber – Using, and not using, OSG
    </a>
</h4>
<p>
    Bennet Fauber highlights the different University of Michigan programs that utilize OSG services,
    including psychology, engineering, and environmental science. There were challenges for each project
    –– however, newly trained students could use OSG to process portions of the large amounts of data.

      Douglas Jennewein – Advancing the Process of Science and Innovation at ASU with OSG
   </a>
</h4>
<p>
   Arizona State University’s research computing department examines intensive data amounts
   through many projects, and OSG services and training have assisted with those projects.
   ASU is currently project-focused on innovation in the computing sector and improving
   functionality and accessibility for its campus and all institutions.
